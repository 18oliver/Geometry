First input should be 3 doubles, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of "Point p".

Second input should be 3 doubles as well, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of "Point q".

Third input should be 4 doubles, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center and radius of "sphereA".

Fourth input should be 4 doubles, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center and radius of "sphereB".

Fifth input should be 4 doubles, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center and side length of "cubeA".

Sixth input should be 4 doubles, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center and side length of "cubeB".

Seventh input should be 5 doubles, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center, radius, and height of "cylA" (Cylinder A).

Seventh input should be 5 doubles, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center, radius, and height of "cylB" (Cylinder B).

This program will give information about the inputted objects.
